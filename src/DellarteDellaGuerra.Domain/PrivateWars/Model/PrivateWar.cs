    /// resolved dynamically from the feudal hierarchy (design §18.A).

    /// MainGoalSettlementId is frozen at declaration (design §18.C). OriginalFiefOwners is the
    /// settlement-to-owner snapshot taken at declaration, used to revert captures on resolution
    /// (status quo ante, design §8). BattleScore is the one *accumulated* score term (capped,
    /// attacker-positive); every other score term is recomputed from current world state each
    /// tick. Score is the last persisted total (for save/load and UI).
    ///
    /// GoalLastTakenDay is the epoch the fatigue term drifts from: it starts at declaration and
    /// resets to the current day whenever the main goal changes hands, so retaking the goal wipes
    /// the accumulated fatigue and the contest restarts its drift toward the new holder.
