# Dellarte Della Guerra

Dellarte Della Guerra (DADG) is an upcoming mod for *Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord*, setting the stage for the English War of the Roses in 1471, opposing the House of York and Lancaster for the English crown.

## Acknowledgements

The mod will integrate and build upon features for jousts, firearms, and cannons from **The Old Realms** mod. You can find the original implementation and details here: [The Old Realms Mod](https://github.com/TheOldRealms/TOR_Core/tree/development). 

We believe that open-sourcing our codebase will also enable other mods to build upon it effectively. However, please note that all XML and assets related to this mod are not available publicly.

## Planned Features

See our [open issues](https://github.com/DellarteDellaGuerraTeam/DellarteDellaGuerra.Core/labels/enhancement) for a list of features we plan to implement.
